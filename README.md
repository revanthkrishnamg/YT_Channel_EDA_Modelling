Flow of the project:
Start with going through 1_Data_Collection.ipynb -> which gathers the relevant data from my YouTube Channel.
Then go through 2_Data_Preparation_EDA.ipynb for data cleaning, pre-processing and EDA.
Then finally go through 3_Classification_Modelling.ipynb for the modelling part, where I developed a classification model which tells us if a video will be either high or low engagement.
